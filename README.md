## Adding new solution and test case

Run the following interactive script to to generate a blank leetcode solution and test case

```
swift Scripts/start-new-problem.swift
```
## Documentation

[![Deploy Documentation](https://github.com/rossmassey/leetcode/actions/workflows/gh-pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rossmassey/leetcode/actions/workflows/gh-pages.yml)


Documentation is generated from the markdown in the solution files, with the DocC documentation compiler

#### [Overview](https://rossmassey.github.io/leetcode/documentation/leetcode/)

#### [Article: Problems organized by Neetcode's Roadmap](https://rossmassey.github.io/leetcode/documentation/leetcode/index)

### Generating

To generate the static documentation in `/_site`, from the repo folder run:

```
bash Scripts/generate-docs.sh
```

To preview the web version, run:

```
bash Scripts/preview-docs.sh
```

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is used to host the static content generated by the "Deploy Documentation" workflow

## Testing and Linting

[![Swift Code Validation](https://github.com/rossmassey/leetcode/actions/workflows/swift.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rossmassey/leetcode/actions/workflows/swift.yml)

Linting can be ran with the [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) tool:

```
swiftlint
```

XCTests can be ran through Xcode or VS Code (with Swift extension), or with:

```
swift test
```

> Note: Current test cases are just the example inputs/outputs provided by Leetcode, and are not comprehensive

## Using Docker

The [Swift image](https://github.com/apple/swift-docker) for docker can be used if Swift is not installed locally

This command ran from the root of the repo will run the tests for instance:

```
docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd):/leetcode" -w /leetcode swift swift test
```
- `docker run`: run a command within a docker container
- `--rm`: removes container once it is done
- `--it`: runs container in interactive mode (to see console output)
- `-v "$(pwd):/leetcode`: mounts current directory to **/leetcode** inside container
- `-w /leetcode`: sets container working directory to **/leetcode**
- `swift swift test`: execute `swift test` using the `swift` docker image
