## Testing

XCTests can be ran through Xcode or VS Code (with Swift extension), or with:

```
swift test
```

To generate an `XCTestCase` from template, enter the following command:

```
Scripts/create-test.swift <solution file>
``` 
 
There is a VSCode Task "Generate Test Case" that can be used when the solution file is opened as well

## Note for VS Code

For new files to be detected by SourceKit-LSP (provided by Swift extension), run `swift build`, and enter the following into the VS Code Command Palette:

```
Developer: Reload Window
```
